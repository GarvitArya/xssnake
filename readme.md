XSSNAKE is written in HTML5 and JavaScript. It works in all browsers that
support Canvas and Websocket. XSSNAKE uses Node.js for the server,
SockJS for clientâ€“server communication, and Google Closure Compiler with
Advanced Compilation to check for errors and to compile to minified and
optimized code.
