Creating/modifying level images
===

These images contain the XSSNAKEâ€™s levels. Generate level data from these images
by opening build.html (parent dir) in your browser and by saving the output to
shared/levels.js. The level data is used by both client and server.

Make sure to save the levels as 0.png, 1.png, 2.png, etc., without gaps.
