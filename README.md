XSSNAKE is written in HTML5 and JavaScript. It works in all browsers that
support HTML5's Canvas and Websocket. XSSNAKE uses Node.js for the server,
Socket.IO for clientâ€“server communication, and Google Closure Compiler with
Advanced Compilation to check for errors and to compile to minified and
optimized code.

**Note: XSSNAKE is in an early stage of development.**

## Initial Setup

 * Clone or download XSSNAKE from https://github.com/blaise-io/xssnake.git
 * Create a configuration file by copying `server/shared/config.example.js` to
   `server/shared/config.js`
 * Adjust the contents of `server/shared/config.js` to match your environment
 * Download and install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 * Install [socket.io](https://npmjs.org/package/socket.io) by running
   `npm install socket.io`
 * Install [gcc-rest](https://github.com/blaise-io/gcc-rest) by running
   `npm install gcc-rest`

## Production

 * Compile the client source: `node build/client.js`
 * Make sure the `www` dir is accessible by browsers
 * Make sure the `server` dir is accessible by node.js
 * Run the game server: `node server/start.js`
 * Access the game by navigating your browser to the `www` dir's public address

## Developing and Testing

 * Run the game server: `node server/start.js`
 * Access the game by opening `source/source.html` in your browser

While testing, it can be useful to automatically reload the server when you
change something. You can do this by installing supervisor: `npm install
supervisor -g`. Run it using `supervisor -w server -n exit server/start.js`.

If you open `source/source.html` from a local disk in Chrome (`file://...`), you
have to start the browser with the `--disable-web-security` parameter to
work around an Access-Control restriction.

After you modify code, it can be useful to compile the code to see if you
made any errors.

 * Compile server code: `node build/server.js` (Warning: this contains a
   hack to inline node.js modules to allow compiling with Google Closure.
   Check `build/lib/server_compile.js` code comments for details.)
 * Compile client code: `node build/client.js`

## Creating/Updating Levels

If you adjusted one of the level images, you have to rebuild
`server/shared/levels.js`. See instructions below. More info on level images
can be found in `source/levels/README.md`.

 * Install [png-js](https://npmjs.org/package/png-js) by running
   `npm install png-js`
 * Run `node build/levels.js`
