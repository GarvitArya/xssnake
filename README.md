XSSNAKE
===
**Note: XSSNAKE is in an early stage of development.**

XSSNAKE is an online multiplayer HTML5 game where the winner of the game is
allowed to execute a JavaScript file in the opponent's browser.

XSSNAKE is written in JavaScript. It uses Node.js for the server, Socket.IO for
clientâ€“server communication, and Google Closure Compiler with Advanced
compilation to compile to compacter and faster code.

Initial Setup
---
 * Download and install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 * Create a configuration file at `shared/config.js` (rename and adjust
   `shared/config.example.js` to match your environment)
 * Install [socket.io](https://npmjs.org/package/socket.io) by running
   `npm install socket.io` in the server dir

Production
---
 * Compile the source: `node build/compile_source.js`
 * Make sure the `www` dir is accessible by browsers
 * Make sure the `server` and `shared` dirs are accessible by node.js
 * Run the game server: `node server/start.js`
 * Access the game by opening the `www` dir at its public address

Developing and Testing
---
 * Run the game server: `node server/start.js`
 * Access the game by opening `source/source.html`

While testing, it can be useful to automatically reload the server when you
change something. You can do this by installing supervisor: `npm install
supervisor` in the server dir. Run it using:
 `supervisor --watch server,shared -n exit server/start.js`.

If you open `source.html` from a local disk in Chrome (`file://...`), you
have to start the browser with the `--disable-web-security` parameter, or the
browser will not connect to the back-end due to an Access-Control restriction.

Creating/Updating Levels
---
If you adjusted one of the level images, you have to re-build
`shared/parse_levels.js`.

 * [`npm install png-js`](https://npmjs.org/package/png-js) in the build dir
 * Run `node build/parse_levels.js`
 * More info on level images can be found in `source/level_images/README.md`
