XSSNAKE
===

*In an early stage of development, does not work yet.*

XSSNAKE will be an online multiplayer game where the winner of the game is
allowed to execute Javascript in the opponent's browser.

XSSNAKE is written entirely in Javascript. It uses Node.js for the server,
Socket.IO for cross-browser clientâ€“server communication, and Google Closure
Compiler with Advanced compilation to compile to compacter and faster code.
